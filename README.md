Welcome to the repo of my personal website.

## Getting started

- install node using `.nvmrc`
- `npm i`

## Development

`npm run dev`

This starts the app in development mode, rebuilding assets on file changes.

## Deployment

The website will automatically be deployed in case of a pull request or commit to main.

### Vercel Edge

This starter site is configured to deploy to [Vercel Edge Functions](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/functions/edge-functions), which means
it will be rendered at an edge location near to your users.
